#Day 1 Printing Start
# Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
print("Hello world!")

input("What is your name?")

===========================
# FIRST PROJECT (BASIC LEVEL)
# Write code to create a band name based on the city you grew up in and the name of your pet

# See code below
============================

# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code below ðŸ‘‡
two_digit_number = input("Type a two digit number: ")
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†
